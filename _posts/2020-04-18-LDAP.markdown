# LDAP OpenDirectory

## Network Admins
If you have a group in your directory with gid 80 then it's members are administrators on all macs that are bound to that directory server. If not you have to add a network user or group to your local admin group.

Members can administer Macs. Each mac must add this group to the admin group in /Local/Default/ via WGM or
dseditgroup -o edit -u <localadmin> -P <pass> -a macadmin -t group admin (via ARD e.g.)

sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a macadmin -t group admin on the client

You still need a local admin for the step above.

Attention: such a admin cannot make changes to /Local/Default … you’d need a „normal“ Admin (grp 80) for that (you can create it as also a MacAdmin … so no problem)
