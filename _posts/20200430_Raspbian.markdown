# Raspbian Lite

Install it. I'Ve found no better distro.

## Network

I tend to disable ipv6 everywhere. Add *ipv6.disable=1* to */boot/cmdline.txt* .

My raspberry pi will have a static IP:

Yes you still configure that in */etc/dhcpcd.conf* 

```
interface eth0
static ip_address=10.1.11.4/24
static routers=10.1.11.1
```
Note that I do not define a nameserver because the pi will be a nameserver himself. To do that add `static domain_name_servers=10.1.11.1`.

## Resolvconfd

No more editing */etc/resolv.conf* :-/ You would edit */etc/resolvconf.conf* although it's usually not necessary cause there's so much magic involved. However you could define things here if needed. I use *dnsmasq* as a local DNS and DHCP server so 127.0.0.1 would be the pi's namesever. But even that happens automatically, becaues /etc/resolvconf.conf knows about dnsmasq's resolv.conf file. However you'll want to add your upstream DNS (8.8.8.8 or the one your provider gave you or simply your main router's ip): `name_server=10.1.11.1`. You might also want to add your search domain such as `search_domain=fritz.box` or the one you invented and serve with dnsmasq.
